ChatCinema: A Conversational Movie Recommendation System
Overview
ChatCinema is a conversational movie recommendation system that uses natural language processing and machine learning to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user input. The system is built using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications, and leverages the power of Groq, a vector database, to store and retrieve movie embeddings.

Features
Conversational interface for users to input movie names or descriptions
Personalized movie recommendations based on user input
Ability to download chat history and encrypted dataset
Decryption tool for encrypted dataset
Generation of new dataset using AI models
Getting Started
To run the application, simply execute the following command in your terminal:


Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will launch the application in your default web browser.

Tabs
The application consists of four tabs:
